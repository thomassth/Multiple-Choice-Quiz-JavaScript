# Multiple Choice Web

Forked from https://github.com/CodeExplainedRepo/Multiple-Choice-Quiz-JavaScript

Test it here https://thomassth.github.io/Multiple-Choice-Web/

## Improvements:

1. Utilizing rem sizing for responsive web
2. Use of CSS grid and flex
3. Time limits disabled by default (far more common imo)
4. Theming improvement
5. Flexibility: you can make quizes without a right answer (like psychological tests)
6. Improved customization in multiple areas
7. Animations!

## Requirement(s)
1. Modern-ish browsers
2. jQuery is needed for content and animations; no idea how to make a dependency-free version yet (please open an issue if anyone think this is the way to go)
